Hey, I'm Alec Featherston. This is my blog about all things programming, but mostly game / web development. Lately in particular I've had a passion for interactive storytelling, so expect to see tutorials on using JSON to store dialogue, story logic and UI information. Hope you find something you find useful or interesting here!
